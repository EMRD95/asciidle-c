# asciidle-c
Previous asciidle bash script completly rewritten in C to optimize CPU load. The program now display random ASCII art stored as .txt files in a terminal window when executed.

Credit to BRANDON '65535' NIBLETT and the maintainers of asciipr0n.com for providing good quality old school ascii art.
